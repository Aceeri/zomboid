description=Evolution BETA runs for 4 real weeks and the zombies evolve every real week. They spread across the map, their senses improve, they get smarter. The server is online 24/7 for 4 real weeks which is almost 2 years in-game. The settings are "mid-core" survival, more immersive than default but not too hard. How long can you survive? This is the first BETA game which ends 06 July. Join us on Discord: https://discord.gg/Qycaref .
